This is a HOWTO for the NRPED implementaion on VMS. This was based on the nrpe
source code (from Ethan Galstad). The original code has been changed in order
to run on VMS machines. The main differences are:
    - fork() on VMS does not provide the same functionality as on Unix
    - some string functions are not available. These had been rewriten
    - connection process changed to work as an auxiliary server (this is the
      implementation of inetd on VMS). This provides multi-session capability

This code has been tested on:
    - Alpha OpenVMS V7.3
      Alpha OpenVMS V7.1
      Alpha OpenVMS V7.1-1H2
      VAX OpenVMS V7.1
    - DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX Version V4.2
      Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX Version V4.2 - ECO 5
      DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Alpha Version V4.2
      Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Alpha Version V5.3 - ECO 1
    - DEC C V5.7-004 on OpenVMS VAX V7.1
      Compaq C V6.5-001 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.3

(if you succeed on other versions, let me know)

These are steps to make it working. Not all mandatory. But this is, I hope, a
clean way to do it.

- Start by compiling the sources:

    $ cc/define=(_VMS_WAIT)/pref=all nrpe_aux,utils,custom,check_nrpe
    $ link nrpe_aux,utils,custom, a/opt
    $ link check_nrpe,utils, a/opt

- Create a user account 
    for example: user nrpe, with sys$login = DKD100:[NRPE]

- Define system wide logical names:

  "NRPE$" = "DKD100:[NRPE]"  ! put here nrpe_aux.exe, check_nrpe.exe, nrpe.com & nrpe.cfg
  "NRPE$LOG" = "DKD100:[NRPE.LOG]"    ! for logs
  "NRPE$SCRIPTS" = "DKD100:[NRPE.SCRIPTS]" ! for plug-ins 

- Define in sys$login:login.com the symboles

	$nrpe_aux == "$nrpe$:nrpe_aux.exe"
	$check_nrpe == "$nrpe$:check_nrpe.exe"
        $ NRPE_ERR == 3
        $ NRPE_OK == 1
        $ NRPE_WARN == 2

- Add NRPE daemon as an auxiliary service in UCX or TCP/IP services. 

        $ ucx
	ucx> set service NRPED /port= 5666 /protocol=tcp -
		  /user=nrpe /process_name=nrped /file=nrpe$:nrpe.com /limit=50
	ucx> enable service nrped

- Example de check_nrpe execution:
  
	$ check_nrpe "-H" 10.2.7.250 "-p" 5666 "-c" check_test
