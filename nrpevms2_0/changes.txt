    09-03-2003   -  Changes:  V2.0b

Platform tested:

    - Alpha OpenVMS V7.3-2
    - HP TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Alpha Version V5.4 - ECO 5
    - HP AXPVMS SSL V1.2
    - HP C V7.1-015 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-2

Changes:
    - nrpe.cfg, howto.txt, changes.txt included
   
    - nrpe.com corrected

    - using arguments added. To unable it, you should: 
       add #define ENABLE_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS in config.h and compile
       add dont_blame_nrpe=1 in nrpe.cfg (0 to disable) 

    - VMS completion codes are managed. Add in sys$login:login.com the symbols
        $ NRPE_OK == 1
        $ NRPE_WARN == 2
        $ NRPE_ERR == 3
       This would be seen on the nagios side as 0/1/2, which are ok/warn/err on
Unix environment.
        Example: check CHECK_DISK.COM in the [.scripts] directory

    - no changes on check_nrpe
